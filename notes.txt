Message Standard Yaml Table notes by polarbunny. Thanks to jkcclemens!

=====

msyt is a YAML format specification for msbt files, allowing easy plaintext reading and writing.

=====

This archive contains a few scripts:

    get-msyts.bat  - Exports msyt files from user supplied msbt files. In lue of that, it fetches vanilla msyt files instead.

    pack-msyts.bat - Automatically converts and packs msyt files into Switch + WiiU Bootup_XXen.pack files.
                     Additionally patches rstb, although not always necessary unless unpacked file size has increased.
                     *** Requires Python 3.6+ 64bit, sarc and rstb ***

Misc notes:

    'text' strings should be surrounded with quotes if there is a blank space at the end of the string that needs to be included.
        Example:

        ...
          - text: "That "
          - control:
              kind: set_colour
              colour: blue
          - text: "Sheikah heirloom "
          - control:
              kind: reset_colour
        ...

    Otherwise, it doesn't matter if quoted or not.

    -----

    'attributes' strings declare which npc is speaking the content within.

    -----

    '\n' denotes a newline in a 'text' string.

    '\"' displays a quote without counting towards encapsulating strings.
